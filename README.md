# Weather Reporter

A simple weather reporting application built with Python and Tkinter that provides current weather details for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- Autocomplete feature for city names to enhance user experience.
- Displays the current temperature, minimum and maximum temperatures, and weather description.
- Automatically adjusts to screen size for a responsive display.
- Alerts for invalid city input or connection errors.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- **Requests library** for handling API requests:
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. **Get OpenWeatherMap API Key:**
   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and get your API key.
   - Replace the `API_KEY` in `weather_utils.py` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

3. **Prepare Icons and Assets:**
   - Ensure the following images are in the project directory:
     - `rsz_backk.png`, `gradient_wallpaper_1.gif`
     - Thermometer icons in the `PNG/` folder (`simple_weather_icon_51.png`, etc.)
     - Small and large weather icons in `icons/` and `big_icons/` folders (`01d.png`, etc.)

4. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## File Structure

- **app.py**: Main script that initializes the GUI, handles user input, and displays weather data.
- **weather_utils.py**: Utility functions to fetch and process weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Usage

1. **Enter a city name** in the input box (autocomplete suggestions available).
2. **Click the "GO" button** to fetch weather information.
3. **View results** on a new window showing temperature, min/max temperature, and weather conditions.

## Error Handling

- If the city name is invalid, a warning will be displayed.
- If there's no internet connection, the app will prompt an alert.

## Dependencies

- `requests` - for making API calls to OpenWeatherMap.
- `tkinter` - for the GUI interface.
